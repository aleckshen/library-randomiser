A simple CLI tool to randomly pick Auckland libraries.

---

## Features

- Pick 1 or more random libraries from Auckland.  
- Display all available libraries.  
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.

---

## Installation (Global)

You can install `pylib` globally so the `pylib` command works anywhere.  

1. Clone the repository and navigate into it:  
`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pylib.git`  
`cd pylib`  

2. Install the package globally:  
`pip install .`  

> If you donâ€™t have admin privileges, you can install for your user only:  
`pip install --user .`  

> On macOS/Linux, if using `--user`, make sure your local bin directory is in your PATH:  
`export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`  
Add that line to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` to make it permanent.
